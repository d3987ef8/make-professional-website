## Why make-professional-website?

  1. *Ease of Use for Beginners*: The simplicity of using YAML over HTML for beginners is a significant advantage. Many people find HTML daunting initially, so this package offers a simpler alternative. There is a focus on ease of use, especially for those new to coding or those who need to create simple websites quickly.
  2. *Niche Market*: There seems to be a niche market for this kind of tool. Beginners who want to create professional-looking websites without diving deep into HTML and CSS, as well as those who prefer a more old-school approach to web development, could find this framework very useful.
  3. *Unique Approach*: This tool's focus on minimal dependencies and code security, combined with the classical approach to frontend work, differentiates it from many modern frameworks. This could appeal to developers who are cautious about the complexity associated with many modern frontend technologies.
  4. Potential Users:
    - Hobbyists and DIYers: Individuals who want to create personal websites or projects.
    - Small Business Owners: People who need a simple, professional web presence without the overhead of learning complex web technologies.
    - Educators and Students: Educational institutions might find this tool useful for teaching the basics of web development without overwhelming students.
